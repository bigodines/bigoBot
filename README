This is the source of my python bot which basically download stuff from the internet. I use to download torrents into a specific directory and configure bitTransmission to automatically add all torrents from this directory thus I have a way to start downloading anywhere, without need a special protocol for it. 

You won't be able to download-and-run my bot. Please edit the source and configure.

Actually.. These first versions are just to test git/gitHub, as I'm a late-adopter :P

yours,
